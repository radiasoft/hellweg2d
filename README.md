### Python and python-wrapped utilities for modeling linear accelerators
The rslinac repository is where RadiaSoft maintains open source software for modeling linacs.  'Linac' is a long-time nickname for 'linear accelerator'. This includes the Hellweg C++ physics kernel, the Windows-only Hellweg GUI, and associated Python code for testing. In the future, rslinac will be broadened to include other software specific to modeling linacs.

#### Rapid simulation of beams in cavities, with beam loading
<a target="_blank" class="btn btn-default lp-code-button" href="/hellweg"><h4>Hellweg</h4></a>

Hellweg is a C++ application for simulating high-average-power, traveling wave (TW) electron linacs, including the important effects of beam loading. It can also be used for modeling beam transport with a variety of standard elements.

Hellweg has a GUI for use on Windows, if compiled with [Embarcadero's C++ Builder](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/cbuilder) using the provided [configuration file](https://github.com/radiasoft/rslinac/blob/master/src/gui/Hellweg.cbproj).

We provide a [User Guide](https://github.com/radiasoft/rslinac/tree/master/docs) and a [Suite of Examples](https://github.com/radiasoft/rslinac/tree/master/src/examples).

The Hellweg physics kernel compiles on Linux without the GUI. The C++ physics kernel provides an API that is called from Python. These Python-wrapped capabilities are referred to as 'rslinac' and will be made available via PyPI.
